	//~Java Execution
	//Javac is command that read source files that contain module, package and type declarations written in the JAVA programming language and compiles them into class files that run on the JVM (JAVA virtual machine)


	//JAVA Access Modifier-Public: Accessible from anywhere in the package and classes.
	//Protected: Accessible from the classes under same package and subclass
	//Default: Accessible by the classes of the same package
	//Private: Accessible only within same class


	//What is A class? A class is a collection of methods and data.
	//What is a Public class? Public means that the class can be access by any other class in any package.


	//**Public static void main(String[] args){}
	//main: Main is a method of the class, While running Java program we've to define main method
	//void: Void returns nothing. We want the method to go forward and no return is expected.
	//Static: Is the type of the method, means we're not expecting any difference inside the method. It is defined as a member of the class rather than a member of an instance of the class.
	//Public: Public means the method is accessible by any class in any package.


	//When we're invoking the class, What I'm saying is "Java Runtime, run the program defined by the public static void main method of Java_Class"



	//Java Data Types
	//**Primitive data type**//

	//byte- Integer-- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example 10 -- Range -128 and 127 -- Size of 8 Bits
	//short-Integer-- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example 10000-- Range -32768 to 32767-- Size of 16 Bits
	//int- Integer- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction. Example --2,147,483,647 Range -2M to -2,147,483,646-- Size of 32 Bits
	//long- Integer- Integer is a whole number that is not fraction.. Ex:--9223372'036'854 Range  -9'223'372'036'854'775'808 to 9'223'372'036'854'775'807 -- Size of 64 Bits = 8 byte
	//float- fractional-Fractional consists of two numbers. (With decimal). Means a numerator and a denominator= Example 10.254756 -- Size of 32 Bits = 4 byte
	//double- fractional-Fractional consists of two numbers. (With decimal). Means a numerator and a denominator= Example 10.2547568985658214-- Size of 64 Bits = 8 byte
	//char- Char is used to store different type of data Example= A,b,c/ 1,2,3/ ?,!,# Size of 16 Bits
	//String- Sequence of character- Example "Myn ame 123 wha t??"
	//Boolean- denotes two type True/False  Size of 1 Bit
	}
